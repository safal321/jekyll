Amazon Prime Day is inching ever closer, and there's already some momentum building with early deals. Tomorrow, July 12th, is slated as the start of the two-day sales event, but you can already take advantage of some nice discounts ahead of the official launch at 3AM ET / 12AM PT. Other retailers are also getting into the mix, so keep on the lookout for sales from the likes of Best Buy and Target, the latter of which has already begun its “Deal Days” event. While Amazon is obviously the star of its own show, it also bears mentioning that Prime Day deals are exclusive to Prime members while competing sales from other retailers are open to all.
